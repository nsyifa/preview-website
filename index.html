            My name is Nasywa Syifa Azizah and I'm a second year computer
            science student. This page is a preview of the things that I have

          <p>
            Most of my experience with Python is in image processing, such as
            enhancements, segmentations, and morphological operations. I am able
            to implement those operations from scratch with and without operator
            functions from popular image processing libraries such as OpenCV. In
            data analysis, I mostly make use of matplotlib and numpy along with
            very surface-level pandas. Python for me is a quick, versatile, and
            powerful language, and I aim to use it for many different types of
            projects in the future.

            <h1>Java</h1>
            <p>
              Java is my first programming language and it's the language that I
              used to learn object oriented programming, data structures, and
              algorithms. I have knowledge of and am able to implement various
              data structures such as trees, graphs, disjoint sets, and hash
              tables, along with operations such as sorting and searching. I
              also have experience in implementing such frequently used
              algorithms as Dijkstra, Kruskal, and Ford-Fulkerson. One such
              experience was a project on a variation of the Travelling Salesman
              problem (or, a multi-destination shortest path problem). Along
              with this, I have delved into developing Android applications
              using Java and am able to create very simple native Android
              applications.

          <p>
            I have basic knowledge of C++, as it is the language that I used to
            learn most of my programming core concepts. I am familiar with the
            syntax and structure of the language and have used it to create
            programs of different lengths, from small, to thousand-line giants.

            I am able to create simple websites and frontends (such as this
            page!) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I aim to improve the
            responsiveness of my websites using web apps and full stack
            frameworks such as React. I'm also very interested in learning more
            about backend, such as using Node.js

          <p>
            My experience with C# stems from my interest in game development and
            is thus limited by it. I have beginner-level experience in using the
            Unity engine for development, and am currently learning how to make
            simple games. Game development also pushed me into using Blender,
            and so I have some experience in using it for both regular 3D
            modelling as well as asset modelling for games.
